10-LinkedStruct
Filtering

Given a Python list of original fruits (as strings), and a Python
list of fruits to fliter out:

1. Convert the original and filter lists into linked structures.
2. Create a resulting linked structure that filters out the filtered
fruits from the original linked structure.
