\subsection*{Problem 1 - Prove that every connected graph all of whose vertices have even degrees contains no bridges}
If we were to consider Graph G with all even degree vertices.
Somewhere in this graph, there is this bridge that joins vertex $x$ to vertex $y$. Upon removing this edge, there are two subgraphs of $G$, $G_{x}$ and $G_{y}$. If we were to consider $G_{x}$, then $G_{x}$ has exactly one vertex with an odd degree and the rest have even degrees. This creates a contradiction of Corollary 2.3, thus every connected graph all of whose vertices have even degrees contains no bridges.


\subsection*{Problem 2 - Let $G$ be a connected graph that $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ be two edges of $G$. Prove that 
$G - e_{1} - e_{2}$ has three components if and only if both $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ are bridges in $G$.}

Forward:\\
By definition, G is connected, therefore it has one connected component. \\
Since $e_{1}$ is a bridge, by definition, $G - e_{1}$ would contain two connected components.\\
However, we do not know if $e_{2}$ is a bridge in $G - e_{1}$. Using Theorem 4.1, we know that if $e$ is a bridge in $G$ and $e \in H \subseteq G$, then $e$ is a bridge of $H$. Therefore we know that $e_{2}$ is a bridge in $G - e_{1}$, which would make the total connected components equal to 3.\\
Backward:\\
If $G - e_{1} - e_{2}$ has 3 connected components, then edges $e-{1}$ and $e_{2}$ are bridges. \\
Using the formula $\kappa(G) \leq \kappa(G - e) \leq \kappa(G) + 1$.
Suppose that e1 is not a bridge, then we know that\\
$\kappa(G - e_{1}) = 1$\\
$1 \leq \kappa((G - e_{1}) - e_{2}) \leq 2$\\ Contradiction
Suppose that e2 is not a bridge, then we know that\\
$\kappa(G - e_{1}) = 2$\\
$2 \leq \kappa((G - e_{1}) - e_{2}) \leq 3$\\ 
$\kappa((G - e_{1}) - e_{2}) = 3$


\subsection*{\newpage Problem 3 - A certain tree $T$ of order 35 is known to have 25 vertices of degree 1, two vertices of degree 2, three vertices of degree 4, one vertex of degree 5 and two vertices of degree 6. It also contains two vertices of the same (unknown) degree $x$. What is $x$? }

Via the Handshake Lemma and knowing that size of tree is its order - 1 (and also featuring my artistic talent)\\

\subsection*{Problem 4 - A certain tree $T$ of order $n$ contains only vertices of degree 1 and 3. Show that T contains $(n âˆ’ 2)/2$ vertices of degree 3}

Let $x$ = the amount of vertices with degree 1.\\
Let $y$ = the amount of vertices with degree 3.\\
$x + y = n$\\
$x + 3y = 2n - 2$
