\subsection*{Problem 1.8
Let S be a finite set of 3-letter and/or 4-letter words. In this case, the word graph $G(S)$ of $S$ is
that graph whose vertex set is S and such that two vertices (words) $w_{1}$ and $w_{2}$ are adjacent if either (1) or (2) below occurs:\\
(1) one of the words can be obtained from the other by replacing one letter by another letter,\\
(2) $w_{1}$ is a 3-letter word and $w_{2}$ is a 4-letter word and $w_{2}$ can be obtained from $w_{1}$ by the
insertion of a single letter (anywhere, including the beginning or the end) into $w_{1}$.\\

\subsection*{
(a) Find six sets $S_{1}$, $S_{2}$, …, $S_{6}$ of 3-letter and/or 4-letter words so that for each integer i $(1 <= i <=6)$ the graph $G_{i}$ of Figure 1.13 is the word graph of $S_{i}$.\\
(b) For another graph $H$ (of your choice), determine whether $H$ is a word graph of some set.\\

\subsection*{Problem 1.16
Let $P = (u = v_{0}, v_{1}, ..., v_{k} = v)$, $k >= 1$, be a $u - v$ geodesic in a connected graph $G$. 
Prove that $d(u, v_{i}) = i$ for each integer $i$ with $1 <= i <= k$.
}

In order for a graph to be connected, there is a path from any point to any other point on the graph.
Because of this connectivity, the shortest path between two points must be $1$. The largest path between any 
two points is the amount of nodes, $k$. Anything in between these two values is the path length from any two points.

\subsection*{Problem 1.19
Theorem 1.10 states that a graph $G$ of order 3 or more is connected if and only if $G$ contains
two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ such that $G − u$ and $G − v$ are connected. Based on this, one might
suspect that the following statement is true. Every connected graph $G$ of order 4 or more
contains three distinct vertices $u$, $v$ and $w$ such that $G$ − $u$, $G$ − $v$ and $G$ − $w$ are connected. Is it$?$
}

This is not true. Adding a third distinct vertex does not further prove that the given graph is connected, rather the opposite.

\subsection*{Problem 1.20
(a)Let $u$ and $v$ be distinct vertices in a connected graph $G$. There may be several connected
subgraphs of $G$ containing $u$ and $v$. What is the minimum size of a connected subgraph of $G$
containing $u$ and $v$? Explain your answer.\\
(b)Does the question in (a) suggest another question to you?
}

(a) Both subgraphs can be single vertices, so the minimum size of a connected subgraph is 1.\\
(b) The suggested question is "What is the minimum possible size for a connected subgraph?"
