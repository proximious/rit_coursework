Group 1 - Christopher and Faraz - 
Snort (A network intrusion prevention and detection system)
Created by Martin Roesch in 1998 to be open-source and lightweight.
Snort is a standard for Intrusion Detection and was recently updated in 2021
It has 3 primary uses, Sniffer, Packet Logger, Network Intrusion Detection System
Packet sniffer - gets the packet from the network
Packet decoder - takes the packets and prepares the packets for processing
Preprocessor - prepates the data for the detection engine
Detection engine - applies the Snort rules to the packets
Ouput modules - processes alerts, logs and generates the final packets
